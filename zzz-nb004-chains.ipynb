       "AIMessage(content='I\\'d be delighted to share a curious story about the Kennedy family!\\n\\nHere\\'s one that might raise an eyebrow:\\n\\nDid you know that the Kennedy family had a secret sister named Rosemary Kennedy? Born in 1918, Rosemary was the third child of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, and the older sister of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and the other Kennedy siblings.\\n\\nRosemary was born with intellectual disabilities and struggled with learning and development. Despite her challenges, she was known to be a kind and gentle soul, loved by her family. However, as she grew older, her condition became increasingly difficult for her family to manage.\\n\\nIn 1941, when Rosemary was 23 years old, her father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., made the controversial decision to have her undergo a prefrontal lobotomy, a then-experimental procedure that aimed to \"cure\" mental illnesses by severing connections in the brain.\\n\\nThe surgery was performed by two doctors, Dr. Walter Freeman and Dr. James Watts, who had developed the procedure. However, the operation was botched, leaving Rosemary with severe cognitive and physical impairments. She was left unable to speak, walk, or care for herself, and was eventually institutionalized.\\n\\nThe Kennedy family kept Rosemary\\'s condition and the lobotomy a secret, even from their closest friends and relatives. It wasn\\'t until the 1980s, decades later, that the story of Rosemary\\'s tragic fate was revealed to the public.\\n\\nRosemary spent the rest of her life in institutions, away from her family and the public eye. She passed away in 2005, at the age of 86, surrounded by her caregivers.\\n\\nThis story is not only a tragic reminder of the dark days of medical experimentation but also a testament to the complexities and secrets that often lie beneath the surface of even the most prominent and influential families.\\n\\nNow, isn\\'t that a curious story about the Kennedy family?', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 403, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 423, 'completion_time': 1.199366286, 'prompt_time': 0.003748285, 'queue_time': 0.010955184, 'total_time': 1.203114571}, 'model_name': 'llama3-70b-8192', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_2f30b0b571', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e6c9a3a9-4ff0-4b78-a2bc-f86f703bcb09-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 403, 'total_tokens': 423})"
